Let's see whether you can concatenate different data types like string and number together. For example, we will concatenate "Hello" with the number "99". 
Unlike Java, which concatenates number with string without declaring number as string, Python requires declaring the number as string otherwise it will show a TypeError

a=”hello”
b=9
Print (a+b)

Once the integer is declared as string, it can concatenate both "hello" + str("99")= "hello99" in the output.

a=”hello”
b=9
Print (a+str(b))
